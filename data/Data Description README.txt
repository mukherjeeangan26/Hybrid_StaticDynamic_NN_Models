
The .mat files contain sample input / output datasets for training and validation of the NN models.

1. DataSet 1: The input_data_1 and output_data_1 correspond to the simulations of a chemical stirred tank reactor system
              subject to step changes in the inlet feed flow rate as well as concentrations of the reaction species in the
              feed stream. The output variables are represented by the outlet concentrations of all reaction species in the
              product stream. 

2. DataSet 2: The input_data_2 and output_data_2 correspond to the measurements obtained from an industrial power plant system.
              The model inputs are represented by the inlet mass flow rates and temperatures of the hot and cold streams of a 
              heat exchanger system, while the outputs are denoted by the outlet temperatures of the streams as well as metal
              temperature of the tubes.
